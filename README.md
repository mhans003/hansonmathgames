## Description

This Node.js application is a collection of simple math games and tools designed for school-aged children (primarily grades 3-5) to build math fluency. 

This application is deployed, fully-functional for players to interact with, and still in development. 

When users are logged in and able to access the games section, the application will save and display the user's personal highest scores as well as the highest user scores overall in each game.  

## Features

* EJS used for simple rendering of data to the user. 
* Bootstrap 4 components including and not limited to grid, navbar, cards, buttons, forms, and modals. 
* MongoDB saves user and high score information.
* Passport used to support authentication. 
* Mongoose incorporated to model user and score data.
